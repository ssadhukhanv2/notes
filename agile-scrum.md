## **Agile || Advantages || Agile Principes || Agile Values**

* [Advantages of using agile over waterfall model(the differences)](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464108#questions/10073948)
  * **faster delivery of software**
  * **Easy to accomodate changes** With iterative waterfall model it's difficult to accomodate changes after requirement, with agile we can easily accomodate changes in each iteration.
  * **Customer feedback is available** With waterfall model the delivery of the software typically ranges from a few months to a few years and there is no way the team can get feedback about the software from the customer before it's delivered. With agile since the working software is delivered in iterations ranging from a few days to a few weeks, the customers can use the software and provide feedback to the devs in each iteration which they can incorporate & add value for the customer.
  * **Team may reflect and adjust based on experience and customer feedback** With agile teams can use the customer feedback & experince to reflect upon themselves and adjust accordingly. This ultimately makes the team more mature.
* [Challenges to using Agile](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464110#questions/10073948)
  *  **Involves a lot of changes:** This is typically a problem for existing large organization which is already working in some different methodology say waterfall. Agile typically involves changes in mindset of the people, change in organization structure and many existing large organization may not be up for it.
  * **Associated Cost and Time** Some organization may choose to use agile for the benefits it offers like faster delivery of software but isn't up for the costs & time associated for example change in organization structure etc, then that agile implementation may not be as successful. New companies are better suited.
  * **Lack of documentation** Problematic for support teams when the project is over or high attrition of employees. Since there is not much documentation, features of existing projects are difficult to be reused in other projects.
  * **Lack of Leadership** since there is no manager to course correct project if there is a problem.







* What are the top 5 agile principles asper your opinion and why.

* [What is Agile](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464094#overview) a mindset or belief system or concept or philosophy consisting of 4 values 12 priciples (think interms of the customer)
* [What are the agile values ](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464096#overview)
  * **Agile Manifesto:** We are ``uncovering better ways``(learning as an organization/team on how to get better at developing software) of delivering software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this we have come to **value**:
    * **Individuals and interactions over ``processes and tools.``**
    * **Working Software ``over comprehensive documentation.``** 
    * **Customer collaboration ``over contract negotiation.``**
    * **Responding to change ``over following a plan.``**
  * **Explaination of the Agile Values:**
    * **Individuals and interactions over ``processes and tools.``**
    This basically means that we believe in face-to-face interactions and conversations instead of waiting for emails and other processes, unless absolutely necessary. Incase of Estimation instead to getting hung up on the size of some work is, we talk interms of the complexities associated.
     * **Working Software ``over comprehensive documentation.``** Instead of getting hung up on creating big elaborate documentation to be delivered at the end of the project, we can deliver the "working software" in small increments to the customer and sharing the knowlege on how it works. This allows the customer to provide feeback which can be incorporated and delivered in the next increment.
    * **Customer collaboration ``over contract negotiation.``**
     Instead of writing a contract based complete requirement(which is not even clear to the customer at day 1), write create a contract keeping customers success in mind where customer collaborates with developers on regular basis to create a software. This promotes interaction with between devs and customer.
    * **Responding to change ``over following a plan.``**
    We must have a plan but developement of software is complex affair, so if anything changes along the way, we must be ready to respond to the change instead of being rigid about the plan and giving customer a hard time.

* [What are the **Agile Principles**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/16447842#overview) Agile principles are a set of guidelines that helps us make decisions on our daily activities
    1.  **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.**
    2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in developement. Agile processes harness change for customers competetive advantage.**
    3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with preference to a shorter time scale.**
    4. **Business People and developers must work together daily throughout the project**
    5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**
    6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a developement team is face to face conversation.**
    7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**
    8. **Agile processes  promote sustainable developement. The sponsers, the developers & the users must be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**
    9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**
    10. **Simplicity - the art of maximizing the work not done - is essential.**
    11. **The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**
    12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts it's behaviour accordingly.**
* Explaination of the Agile Principles:
  1.  **``(TOP 5)`` ``(TOP 5)`` Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.** This principle basically talks about ``delivering value faster to the customer``, i.e. delivering the working software to the customer on a weekly or biweekly basis, so that customer can provide feedback, which can be incorporated in the next iteration to create more value for the customer. This is different from the waterfall model where the software is delivered at the end of a cycle.
  2. **``(TOP 5)``Welcome changes to requirements, even late in developement. Agile processes harness change for customers competetive advantage.** Business processes are changing and evolving. So if there is a change in requirement from the business, which actually creates value for the customer, agile team should be ``welcoming those changes``. 
  3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to couple of months, with preference to a shorter time scale.** The ``working software``(not documents/mark ups) should be delivered to the customer in ``short iterations``(ranging from a few weeks or months) so that customers can get their hands dirty on the working software and provide feedback, which the agile devs can incorporte to create more value for the customer.
  4. **``(TOP 5)``Business People and developers must work together daily throughout the project** In agile the ``business people and the devlopement teams collaborate on a daily basis`` to create the working softare. They work together  to find out what has changed and how that may be incorporated into the software. Since the devs and business people engage regularly, there is less need for addional layers like a Business Analyst who acts as an intermediary between Business people and Devs.
  5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the support they need and trust them to get the job done.** Ideally within an agile team there is no concept of project manager. Get some intelligent motivated indivduals as part of team who are cross-functional(can take up various roles if required) and give them the space to work(not just create software but solve problem for the business)
  6. **``(TOP 5)`` The most efficient and effective method of communicating within a developement team is face to face conversation** Instead of resorting to emails, tickets, etc agile team believes in ``having a conversation face to face conversation``. For example to get a new feature to be developed, instead of creating an elaborate document and sending email to the dev team to create it, the business team may explain the requirements to the devs in a meeting and then share the document for reference purposes.
  7. **``(TOP 5)`` ``(TOP 5)`` Working software is the primary measure of progress** Instead of measuring how much analysis has been done or how much mocks & mark ups has been created, the ``primary measure of progress for agile team is the number of features delivered within the working software`` to the customer.
  8. **Agile Process promote sustainable developement. The sponsers, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely** In traditional waterfall model each team BA, DEV & QA teams are typically stressed about meeting the deadlines and once they are done the softare is moved to prod and everyone is stressed out. In agile the key features of the working software is identified by the crossfunctional team(business, dev, qa), the features are then prioritized based on the team's capacity and delivered in iterations & feedback is received from customer. The entire team is involved in decision making  which makes it possible to maintain a constant sustainable pace.
  9. **Continous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility** ``Think about quality of the software, pay attention to technical excellence as you are building the software`` because it's much harder to build software in the future on top of bad design or poor quality software. So good design and good quality allows teams to build more features(welcome change) in the future, there by promoting agility.
  10. **``(TOP 5)`` Simplicity - the art of maximizing amount the work not done - is essential.** Just because a software has more features doesn't make it pleasant to use. For example the google's landing page has minimal design yet it adds so much value. In agile we look forward to what kind of out come is expected, so we can deliver more by building less, so we need to make sure we are delivering value in everything that is being build, not just building something for the sake of building it.
  11. **The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.** The agile teams are self-organizing and cross-functional, which means that depending on what type of projects you are working on you will already have the right people within your team itself. So team already has the right people in place that may be required to make project a sucess. For example if the team is having some question about an architecture, the team already has an architect within the team rather than borrowing some architect from a different team.
  12. **``(TOP 5)`` ``(TOP 5)`` At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts it's behaviour accordingly** With every iteration the agile team learns more about the team members and new ways of working, so ``in each iteration the team reflects on what went well, what didn't go well, how it can improved & adjusts accordingly``. So typically agile teams reflects and adjusts in every iteration(typically weekly or biweekly) thereby making the team mature over time. With waterfall reflect and adjust is there but it generally has a larger time frame(end of the project).









## **SCRUM || values || Roles || Artefacts || Ceremonies**

* [What is **Scrum**?](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464116#questions)
Scrum is a lightweight framework designed by Agilists to solve complex problems that requires sprinting or iterating through a solution. Scrum values inspection, adaption & transperency. 
  * **Inspect and Adapt:** Scrum teams typically starts of with developing solutions to problems and in the process gets better at solving the problems.
  * **Trasperency** In scrum the roles and responsibilities are properly defined and the scrum events(meetings) are organized in such a way that everyone in the team has a clear picture of what each other is working on.
  * **Sprint** Sprint is a timebox event ranging from a week or two(decided by the team) where the team plans, develops and delivers the software.
  * Scrum is basically an agile way of developing a  software or any project.
  * Scrum is a framework rather than a methodology that helps the team be more agile.
  * Scrum recommends a self organizing and cross-functional team.
  * If there is a challege or conflict between team, they should come together, discuss and decide a way to move forward within a team.


## **SCRUM Values  ||  ``Openness`` || ``Commitment`` || ```Focus``` || ``Courage`` || ``Respect``** || **Scrum Sprint**
* [What are the **Scrum Values**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464118#questions)
    * **Openness**: Rather than just half heartedly following the scrum ceremonies and events, teams should be ``open to actually living scrum`` by adapting and figuring out better ways of developing a software and solving problems. Team member should also be ``open to other people's ideas`` and being ``open to change in general``.
    * **Commitment** In addion to ``committing to the sprint goals``, team members ``commit to each other`` by working together as a team and bring value to the customer by providing solutions collaboratively. Team also commits to give their best action and efforts.
    * **Focus**: Team must ``focus on amount of work planned for the sprint`` rather than focussing on all shiny things and building everything. Team must also be ``focussed customer happiness`` thereby adding value to end users.
    * **Courage**: It is desired that team members have the ``courage to come up with bold ideas`` when working with tough problems and they are ``not afraid of change``.
    * **Respect**: ``Respect each other in a team`` and ``embraces the differences``(different opinions, ways of working, solving problems, culture and background)


* [What is a **Sprint**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464120#questions) [Read more..](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints) A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Typical sprint duration is 1 to 4 weeks.

## **Scrum Roles || ``Product Owner`` || ``Scrum Master`` || ``Developement Team``**
* [What are the **roles in a Scrum Team**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464122#questions)
  * [**Product Owner**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/13194524#announcements) Product owner talks to the business stakeholders and users to understand their needs and vision for the product. Then he/she comes back to the team and helps the team understand the product vision(what problems the stakeholders are trying to solve). Gives the team some description about the product to be build in form of userstories.
  * [**Scrum Master**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/13194524#announcements) Scrum master is the servant leader role. He/she helps team to remove any impediments/road blocks that is encountered throughout the sprint. Also coaches the team so that team understands Scrum  and organises all the scrum ceremonies.
  * [**Developement Team**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/13194524#announcements) All members of the scrum team apart from the Product owner and scrum master is the developement team. It's a group of people(architect, BA, developer, QA analyst etc)  who are capable of delivering a potentially releasable increment at the end of a sprint. Dev team is cross functional and self organizing and accountable as a team. Typically consists of **3 to 9 people**.<br/><br/>
  * [Other Roles](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/13194524#announcements)
    * Project Sponsor: Warrick
    * Business Leader: Janine 
    * SME/Senior Users: 
    * Business Users
    * Technology Leader: Andre, Elizma


## **Scrum Ceremonies || ``Daily Standup`` ||  ``Spring Planning`` || ``Sprint Review`` || ``Sprint Retrospective`` || ``Backlog Grooming``**

* [What is the need for the Daily Standup/Scrum](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12488544#questions) This meeting occurs daily to inspect how the team is performing to achieve the sprint goals and find out if there are any impediments. It's held at the same place and at the same time daily typically for 15 mins or less. All scrum team members joins this meeting answers 3 questions:
    1. What did you do yesterday to achieve the sprint goal.
    2. What will you do today that will help us achieve the sprint goal.
    3. Is there any impediments that might hinder us from achieving the sprint goal.
  
    **Scrum Master** facilitates this meeting. The product owner/stakeholders are encouraged to join but not allowed interrupt by asking questions. The dev team is the main player in this meeting.
* [What is the use of the Sprint Planning session](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12488548#questions) Sprint planning is the event that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered within the sprint and how that can be achieved. We need to plan not just for developing the software, but testing it and shipping it to the customer so that customer can use it and provide feedback. Sprint Planning is done in collaboration of the entire scrum team. 
  
    **Scrum Master** facilitates this meeting. 
    
    **Product Owner** is the key player in this meeting, he has the product vision and explains the priority of the items to the dev team. 
  
    The **Dev team** then discusses to finalizes what can be delivered within the sprint. For a ``2 week sprint`` the ``Sprint Planning session would be for 2 hrs``.

    **Sprint backlog** is the main outcome of the Spring Planning meeting. Sprint back log is the amount of work that is ``identified & agreed by the team members to be completed within a sprint``.

* [What happens in the Sprint Review session](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12488550#questions) 
    * Sprint review meeting is conducted at the last day of the Sprint to share outcomes of the Sprint to external stakeholders. 
    * The team may look at product back log that might inform priority for the next sprint. 
    * Sprint reviews are attended by the entire team including the product owner. 
    * Sprint reviews are between 1 and 2 hours in long. 
    * It is an informal meeting for the team to show some of the progess that they have made. 
    * The uses cases for the increment may also be discussed.

* [What do you mean by Sprint Retrospective](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12488552#overview) 1 hr meeting for a 2 week sprint and 2 hr meeting for a 4 week sprint. Scrum Master facilitates this meeting. Team gather data regarding the challeges and conflicts in the last spring and draws insights from it. Based on these insights the team prepares with a list of things that they want to be mindful of in the next sprint.
  Questions asked in retrospective:
    1. What went well.
    2. What didn't go well
    3. What shoud we improve
* [What is Backlog Gromming/Refinement](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12488554#overview) In backlog grooming, the product backlog is reprioritized and user stories are resized and refined(as appropriate) in preparation for the next sprint. Typically add more details to the user stories. Business analyst plays a key role in this meetings.<br/>
  

## **Scrum Terms and  Scrum Artefacts || ``User Story`` || ``INVEST`` || ``Acceptance Criteria`` || Product Backlog || Sprint Backlog || Working Agreement || Defination of Ready || Defination of done || ``Product Increment`` || ``Team Velocity`` || ``Burnup Chart`` || ``Burndown Chart``**
* [What is an User Story](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464134#overview) User story is a small description of a product feature that is written from an users point of view. It has 3 things:
  * **``Who``**: Who is the user
  * **``What``**: What will we empower our customers to do
  * **``Why``**: What kind of value will it bring if we develop the feature
      
        User story Format:
        As a "Business User"
        I "want to login to the application"
        So that "I can view the homepage"
  * 3 C
    * **Card** : Product owner understands the requirement of a feature and puts it in a card in form of user story
    * **Conversation**: Then PO explains the user story to the devs and makes appropriate modification to the US as required
    * **Confirmation**: PO & Team members collectively discuss and decide the acceptance criteria for the user story.
* [Explain the features of a good user story](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464136#announcements): A good user story should be:
    * **I``ndependent``** An user story should not dependant on other user stories,
    * **N``egotiable``** User stories are not a specific contract for features. This means they can be changed based on understanding & discussion with team and user
    * **V``aluable``** Each user story should have concrete value for the user
    * **E``stimatable``** Each user story should be written in a such a way that we have good understanding of the complexity.
    * **S``mall``** Each user story should be small enough to fit within a sprint
    * **T``estable``** User story should be testable

* [What do you mean by Acceptance Criterias for an user story](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12492406#overview) Acceptance criterias are simple notes or conditions added to the user story, that tells what the user story must do satisfy the needs of the customer
  
          User story:
          As a "New Student"
          I "want to be able to create a new account"
          So that "I can enroll in a course"
          Acceptance Criteria:
          1. User should be able to create account from linkedin
          2. User should be able to create accound from google
          3. User should be able to create new account using email id & password

    Product owner writes the acceptance criteria and discusses with the dev team to come to a conclusion on what is the acceptance criteria.

  * Properies of acceptance criteria
 
    * Acceptance criteria should be testable with clear pass/fail result.
    * Acceptance criteria should be clear and consise.
    * Acceptance criteria should be created with shared understanding.
    * 3-7 acceptance criteria per user story.



* [What is a Product Backlog & Sprint Backlog](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464138#overview)

  * **Product Backlog**: Product Backlog is the prioritized list of user stories outlining the needs of the business. The product backlog typically tend to grow over time as more requirement is added by the business. The scrum team pulls user stories having the highest priorities in the Product Back log. The Product backlog reflects the Product Vision. This is owned by the Product Owner. The Product Backlog can contain fully detailed user stories, but it can also contain ideas and partial user stories - they are iterated in the Product Backlog and finalized before being committed to a Sprint Backlog
  * **Sprint Backlog**: The Sprint Backlog contains the user stories the team is committing to complete in the upcoming sprint. It's the outcome of the spring planning session.


* [Why are Working Agreements and why do we need them](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464142#overview): In a scrum team, the team members collaborate together so there may be chances of conflicts within a team. A Working Agreement is a list of rules, expectations and procedures that govern how a team will work together, this helps avoids conflict within the team. The working agreement must have buy in from every team members. It is a living document meaning it may be updated and changed as needed.

* [What is Defination of Ready for an User Story](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12471044#announcements) Defination of ready means that a user story has sufficient details for the dev team to work on it.
  These details include who, what & why, along with the acceptance criterias. 

* [What is Defination of Done for an User Story](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12486030#announcements) Defination of done is usually a document created by the team and is available to all team memebers. It's essentially a checklist used by Scrum teams to create a shared understanding of what is required to make a piece of work releasable. For example following may be considered some items of the checklist:
    1. User story meets the acceptance criteria provided by the product owner.
    2. The user story(or that unit of work) must be properly tested.
    3. Code review done by another developer in the team.
    4. Lightweight documentation on what was being done.
    5. Story is given to the product owner for review.

    Defination of done may vary from project to project but it's important to have it chalked out as in agile there is no strict project phases.

* [What is a Product Increment](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12471058#announcements) Product increment is potentially shippable, vertical slice of solution that is created as part of a sprint time box.

* [What is Team Velocity](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464156#announcements)
  * **Committed Velociy**: The total number of story points committed in the Spring Backlog.
  * **Actual Velocity**: The total number of story points actually delivered in a sprint.<br/>
  
  If the Actual Velocity & Committed Velocity for a team differs broadly then the team may need to make adjustments to the committed velocity in subsequent sprints or look at & better manage the impediments & roadblock due to which the stories could not be delivered. 

* [Explain what are Burndown Chart](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464158#announcements) The burndown chart is a visual representation of work being completed through the various sprints of the projects. It plots the graph of the ``Ideal Work Remaining Line with respect to Actual Work Remaining Line``. 
  * **Ideal Work Remaining Line** Ideal work remaining line indicates ``the remaining work/story points that a team has at a specific point of the project or sprint under ideal conditions``. This is an estimate based on **past data**.
  * **Actual Work Remaining Line** The actual work remaining line ``indicates the remaining work a team has at any point of the project or sprint``. This is **actual data** based on the Teams Velocity<br/>

  Typically in the initial sprints for new scrum teams the Actual Work Remaining line may be below the Ideal Work Remaining Line but it picks up as the team matures over subsequent sprints. If we fall behined, we may need to look at avenues like adding more sprints.


* [What is the Burnup Chart](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464160#announcements) Since in agile projects the business requirements typically change and user stories are prioritized or deprioritized frequently. The Burn Up chart plots the ``number of story points completed over time`` with respect to the ``total prioritized story point for the project`` to be completed. When the project completes both the lines meet. Burn up chart is often used within project to get a visual understanding of where we are within the project and what has changed over time.

## **Agile Estimation Techniques || ``BUS`` || ``TShirt Sizes XS,S,M,L,XL,XXL`` || ``Fibonacci Sequence``**


* [What do you mean by estimation in Agile](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/16446712#announcements) Estimating in agile refers to making an educated guess regarding how long will it take for a user story to be completed(defination of done). The following may be used for purposes of estimation:
    1. Elicited Information for stakeholders of the team
    2. Past experiences of delivering user stories.
    3. Available documentation

* [How to estimate user stories in Agile](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464144#announcements)
  1. **Relative Estimate**: In agile we estimate a user story with relative to other userstories we have already delivered. For example how big or small a user story is with respect to a user story with 8 story point.
  2. **Placed in a Bucket**: We may segregate user stories in a buckets, each buck will hold user story of a relative size. For example we may use Tshirt sizes or numbers in a fibonaci sequence for the bucket labels.
  3. **Updates to estimation usually has minor impact**: Since we are using relative estimates, slippages has minimal impact.

* [**Importance of Estimation**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464148#announcements)
  1. **Provides estimated duration.**
  2. **Drives out clarification questions.** Since we are getting someone to provide an estimate, the person will have a sense of commitment and asks additional clarification questions in order to provide estimation.
  3. **Highlights complex tasks and risks** that were previously unaccounted for. We get a sense of how long something will take.

* [Common Estimation Techniques 1 **BUS & TShirt Sizes**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464150#announcements)
* [Common Estimation Techniques 2 **Fibonacci Sequence**](https://tcsglobal.udemy.com/course/agile-fundamentals-scrum-kanban-scrumban/learn/lecture/12464154#announcements)

  * **Big/Uncertain/Small(BUS)**: Each story is compared to others and assigned to a group. Mostly companies that newly adopting agile or companies who want to keep their estimation process minimal uses BUS.
    * **``Big``**: Big stories should be broken up if possible.
